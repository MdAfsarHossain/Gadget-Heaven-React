# [Gadget Heaven](https://mdafsarhossain-gadget-heaven.surge.sh/)
### Gadget Heaven is an e-commerce platform dedicated to selling the latest gadgets. It features a structured navigation bar, category-based sidebar, and individual product pages with detailed specifications. Users can add items to a shopping cart or wishlist, view a summary dashboard, and sort items by price. Using the Context API the platform supports data persistence for cart and wishlist functionalities. The responsive design ensures a smooth user experience across devices, and unique elements, such as a modal-based purchase confirmation and price vs. product stats chart, enhance engagement.
